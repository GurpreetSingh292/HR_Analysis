HR Analysis: Employee Attrition at AtliQ Grands
In my HR analysis project for AtliQ Grands, I focused on understanding employee attrition rates to identify key factors influencing turnover. Utilizing Excel, Pivot Tables, Power Query, and Power BI, I gathered and analyzed historical data to uncover insights into why employees are leaving the company.

Key aspects of the analysis included:

Attrition Rates: Evaluated overall turnover rates and trends over time to identify peak periods of employee departures.

Departmental Breakdown: Analyzed attrition by department to determine which areas were experiencing higher rates of turnover, helping to pinpoint specific challenges.

Gender Ratio: Assessed the gender distribution of employees leaving the company to understand diversity dynamics within the workforce.

Reasons for Leaving: Investigated primary factors contributing to employee exits, such as compensation issues, work-life balance, and career growth opportunities.

Through detailed visualizations and data modeling in Power BI, this analysis provided actionable insights that can inform strategic HR initiatives aimed at improving retention, fostering employee satisfaction, and ultimately driving business success at AtliQ Grands.
